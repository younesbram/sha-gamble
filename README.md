#  (sha-256) secure gambling
Using a hash function to determine the winner of a rock-paper-scissors game can prevent malicious guessing by making it difficult for an attacker to predict the outcome. The choices made by the players are input into the hash function, which generates a unique hash value. This value is then used to determine the winner. Since the hash function is one-way, it is infeasible to recreate the original choices from the hash value. An attacker would need to try all combinations of choices and generate the corresponding hash values, which would take a significant amount of time and resources. This helps ensure that the game is played fairly and the results are determined by chance.
